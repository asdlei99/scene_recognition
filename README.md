    Users could upload the picture of building or scene which they appreciated but do not know location, 
    then the software will find out several most similar places and rank them according to the similarity. 
    Then, after users choosing their favorite item, more information of these similar places such as address, 
    more photos, will also be provided to the users to help them find the location.let's say that sometimes 
    we would come across some pictures of beautiful buildings or scenes we do not know, such as the photo of 
    splendid churches, the photo of the green glass in a small park or even a class buildings picture, etc. 
    We want to visit these places ourselves, but we do not know how to find them. Thus, if we have a software 
    which could recognize the places, then we could find out the location of these beautiful places.Example
